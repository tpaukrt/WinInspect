# Window Inspector

## Introduction

  The Window Inspector is a simple tool that allows retrieving class names
  and texts of windows or control elements of any running application.
  In the case of programs written in Delphi or C++Builder, it therefore
  allows to find out the names of the used components.

## Prerequisites
